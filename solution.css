To fix the issue, we can increase the specificity of the `.container p` selector or use the !important flag (though this is generally discouraged for maintainability):

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: red !important; /* Less preferred solution */
}

/* Or a more specific selector */
.container > p {
  color: red;
}
```

Using a more specific selector such as `.container > p` directly targets paragraph elements that are direct children of the element with class `container`, providing higher specificity without resorting to `!important`.
