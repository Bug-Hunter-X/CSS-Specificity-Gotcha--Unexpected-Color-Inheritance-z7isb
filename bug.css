The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: red;
}

<div class="container">
  <p>This text should be red.</p>
</div>
```

The intended behavior is that the text should be red because of the more specific class selector `.container p`. However, due to the way CSS specificity works, the `div p` selector might take precedence, resulting in blue text.
